accesibility
---

images need alt tags
divs with background images need "aria-label" that describes the image
anchor links that don't have any text (like icons) need "aria-label"
anchor links with icons or divs for design only should have "aria-hidden"
svgs, even if used via "<img>" should have a "<title>" and "<desc>" that describes the svg
form inputs should have an associate label with a "for" attribute that is equal to "id" and "name" attribute of the input
figure elements need captions
if you an anchor that doesn't take you anywhere else but instead reveals some content on the page then add "role=button"
